###Next Time Be Carefull
    In Controller I use Pagination Default Value, actually that's doesn't need because it already in Every Model.

    Now I write all relation in a file but it need to write in separate file.
    
    I used public method for call Model but it need to call by Constructor Inject or set method in protected property.
    
### Need to add Feature
    Add media type in media model and change type file type to media type. Ex Image, Video, etc.
